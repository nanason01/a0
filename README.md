This is my annoying clock.

The x position represents the seconds, the y position the minutes (moving up each minute), and the number of sprinkles is the hour.
The background color changes two times per second, the cat oscillates once per second,
and I couldn't decide whether I liked the guidelines or not, so you can click to enable minute indicators.
