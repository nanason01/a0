Welcome!

This is my silly clock.

The x position represents the seconds,
the y position the minutes (moving up each minute),
and the number of sprinkles and rainbow segments are the hour.
The background color changes two times per second,
the cat oscillates once per second,
and I couldn't decide whether I liked the guidelines or not,
so you can click to enable rough minute indicators.
It also flies in and out at the change of each minute.

Enjoy!
